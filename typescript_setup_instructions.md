# HAG TypeScript Setup Instructions

## Repository Initialization

The TypeScript implementations need to be set up as separate Git repositories. Here are the commands to initialize and push them to GitHub:

### Traditional TypeScript Variant (hag_js)

```bash
# Navigate to the traditional TypeScript directory
cd ../hag_js

# Initialize git repository
git init
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: HAG Traditional TypeScript Implementation

Complete TypeScript migration of HAG HVAC system with traditional patterns:

üèóÔ∏è Architecture:
- Dependency Injection: @needle-di/core with decorators
- Validation: Zod schemas with type inference
- CLI Framework: @cliffy/command
- Error Handling: Class-based exceptions
- Async Patterns: Traditional async/await

üöÄ Features:
- Full HVAC control logic with heating/cooling strategies
- Advanced defrost cycle management with timing constraints
- XState v5 state machine with complete state transitions
- Home Assistant WebSocket/REST client with reconnection
- LangChain AI agent for intelligent HVAC decisions
- Comprehensive CLI with validate, status, override commands

üìä Implementation:
- Complete functional parity with Python HAG system
- Type-safe configuration with Zod validation
- Comprehensive test suite (unit + integration)
- Mock services for isolated testing
- Example configurations with environment variables

üéØ Production Ready:
- Deno runtime for fast execution
- Single binary compilation
- Cross-platform deployment
- Full error handling and recovery
- Performance optimized

Tech Stack: TypeScript + Deno + @needle-di + Zod + XState + LangChain"

# Add remote and push (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hag_js.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Effect-TS Functional Variant (hag_ts)

```bash
# Navigate to the Effect-TS directory
cd ../hag_ts

# Initialize git repository
git init
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: HAG Effect-TS Functional Implementation

Complete TypeScript migration of HAG HVAC system with functional patterns:

üèóÔ∏è Architecture:
- Dependency Injection: Effect Context/Layer system
- Validation: Effect Schema with transformations
- CLI Framework: @effect/cli
- Error Handling: Effect tagged errors
- Async Patterns: Effect.Effect monads

üöÄ Features:
- Full HVAC control logic with Effect-native patterns
- Advanced defrost cycle management with resource safety
- XState v5 + Effect integration for state management
- Home Assistant client with Effect error handling
- LangChain AI agent with Effect-native operations
- Comprehensive CLI with Effect-native error recovery

üìä Implementation:
- Complete functional parity with Python HAG system
- Type-safe configuration with Effect Schema
- Comprehensive test suite with Effect patterns
- Layer-based mock services
- Effect error handling and resource management

üéØ Production Ready:
- Effect-TS for functional programming excellence
- Composable and testable architecture
- Resource-safe operations with automatic cleanup
- Concurrent operations with Effect.all
- Proper error recovery and retry logic

Tech Stack: TypeScript + Deno + Effect-TS + Effect Schema + XState + LangChain"

# Add remote and push (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hag_ts.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## GitHub Repository Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repositories

Create two new repositories on GitHub:
- `hag_js` - For the traditional TypeScript implementation
- `hag_ts` - For the Effect-TS functional implementation

### 2. Repository Settings

For both repositories, set up:

**Description**: 
- `hag_js`: "HAG HVAC Automation - Traditional TypeScript Implementation with @needle-di"
- `hag_ts`: "HAG HVAC Automation - Effect-TS Functional Implementation"

**Topics**: Add these tags for discoverability
```
hvac, home-assistant, typescript, deno, automation, climate-control, ai, langchain
```

Additional tags:
- `hag_js`: `needle-di`, `zod`, `traditional`, `oop`
- `hag_ts`: `effect-ts`, `functional-programming`, `fp`, `effect-schema`

**README**: Both repositories will have their own README.md files

### 3. Branch Protection (Optional)

Set up branch protection rules for `main` branch:
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date

## Post-Setup Tasks

After pushing both repositories:

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure README.md files are comprehensive
2. **Set up CI/CD**: Consider GitHub Actions for testing and deployment
3. **Add Issues/Projects**: Set up issue templates and project boards
4. **Configure Security**: Set up security policies and dependency scanning
5. **Add Collaborators**: Invite team members if needed

## Development Workflow

### Testing
```bash
# Traditional TypeScript
cd hag_js
deno task test
deno task test:coverage

# Effect-TS
cd hag_ts  
deno task test
deno task test:watch
```

### Building
```bash
# Both variants
deno task build  # Creates executable binary
```

### Development
```bash
# Both variants
deno task dev --config config/config.yaml
```

## Deployment Examples

### Docker
```dockerfile
FROM denoland/deno:1.40.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN deno task build
CMD ["./hag", "run", "--config", "config/config.yaml"]
```

### Binary Distribution
```bash
# Cross-platform compilation
deno compile --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env --allow-write \
  --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu -o hag-linux src/main.ts
deno compile --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env --allow-write \
  --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -o hag-windows.exe src/main.ts
deno compile --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env --allow-write \
  --target x86_64-apple-darwin -o hag-macos src/main.ts
```

Both TypeScript implementations are production-ready and provide enhanced performance, type safety, and developer experience compared to the original Python implementation.
